Even though someone in front of us was yelling at them they were still fast and great people!
Even though this wine is nicely dry and crisp, it's too vegetal, with a green bean taste.

Floral and pretty in ripe peach and pineapple/mango, it unwinds with a finish of vanilla.
Flowery and sweet, with apricot, buttercup and banana flavors in a soft texture.

For Kids and Kids at heart. In my opinion, the park is worth more than I paid for.
For Macs but fyi it goes out after 45mn and just need to be unplugged and back in. Not a big deal.
For a compact park, it certainly offers a lot of entertainment for the whole family.
For a reason is has been called:  the happiest place on Earth
For a reasonably healthy snack, these were fine.
For a relaxing pace, spend one day at Disneyland and another day for California Adventure Park.
For fast food lovers. It is well located. They always serve you quickly

For the money, this strap is as good as any other poly strap.  Plus, it was made in the U.S.A.!
For the price, it's a very complete phone. I really didn't expect it to be such a versatile and nice.And has all I need on it! Just loving it!
For the price, you get a rich, sweet Chardonnay, plush in pineapple, honey and oak flavors.
For the quality of food that McDonald's has it amazes me the cost of it?
For what it is, it's great. Moved kid from a flip phone to this and he is happy. Works as expected.
Forced to use kiosk to order even when lobby is empty.  Took awhile to get ice cream cones.  Clean.
Forget Molecular Gastronomy - this stuff rockes a coffee creamer!

Mom's Favorite
More Than A Little Mint
More crowded than expected for February.  Probably because weather was fabulous
More expensive online
More suspenseful, more subtle, much, much more disturbing....
Morning afternoon or night, they never have frappes
Most delicious way to get your green tea fix
Most disgusting mistake of my life.
Most flavors are good, but strawberry is too strong
Most of the tables aren't cleaned.
Most of the time this works wonders. 
Mostly a bag of sugar
Mostly always good.
Mourvèdre and Syrah comprise this Rhône blend. Hard and tannic, with thin, generic red fruit.
Much better than I expected
Much better than expected, great for the kids
Much better than the other brand I bought.
Much better than what I've been using.
Much more effective than Cipro.

Phone crashes, WiFi not stable on either 2.4 or 5g. Constantly hitting the on, off button due to its location.
Phone is great condition and working order as described. No issues at all with purchase, very pleased overall with phone.
Phone looked great!! Looked almost brand new. Everything was packaged beautifully and even came with headphones and a charger!
Phone took 4 hours to activate at Verizon and They had to end up calling APPLE to get the phone going! Ridiculous...was not happy
Phone waa a great purchase, was in great condition no scratches came in an iphone 4 box which was a nice touch.
Phone was STOLEN, Verizon said it was a blacklisted stolen MEID number. Pathetic.
Phone was network locked and did not meet my expectations at all..aweful service!!
Phone was nice no scratches or dents it's was better than I expected and it came quickly I think in 4 days
Phone was not new as listed on Amazon. Phone was blacklisted so it couldn't be used. I was very disappointed with this purchase.
Phone was not unlocked. Couldn't use it. Took forever to get my money back from DavisMax.
Phone was unlocked, but didn't come in a box and there was no ear piece. Therefore not sure if it was new as it was advertised
Phone works like a charm. Great buy for the money. This phone is way better than what I was expecting.
Phone would not charge. Had to send back.
Picked the wrong week.  It's spring break.  So, had to go at 8am to avoid heavy traffic.

We all had a fantastic day ....its Disney after all..and no one does it quite like Disney.
We always have the best time here!! Laughing all day!!! Love it!!! Love it!!!
We and our 4 children explored Disneyland for 3 fantabulous days.
We arrived, as it was somewhat early. Everything was closed and the salvation was Mc Donalds
We can't able to use this app.
We do not need all the fancy applications and stuff, just wanted a good mobile phone and this one fills the bill very nicely.
We had a really good time and the hotel was also really nice. Would diff do it again
We had not visited the park in 17 years.  It was beautiful for the holidays
We have a 2 and 4 year old and there were tons of rides for both of them!
We have a good time with my small kids at Disneyland park but too hot.
We just love Disney, our children are 6 and 3. The magic of Disney is just fabulous.
We like 'em!
We love Disneyland and go at least once a year!  Fun and magical for kids and adults!
We love Disneyland and would go more if it were closer.  It is definitely on our  1 places to go...
We love Disneyland!   Clean, Fun, Exciting, Memorable...
We love Disneyland, can't wait to go back.  However, it is really expensive!!
We love its French fries and chocolate frappe
We loved everthing about Disneyland, go off peak Jan Feb and short or no line ups for the rides.
We poured ours out
We stayed for 4 days and found there was a ton to do at the two parks.
We traveled with family and had a blast! We will definitely be back soon.
We waited 11 years to go and it was worth the wait!  The best 4 days with my kids EVER!
We waited in the drive-through Lane for 20 minutes for our food they were very disorganized
We were able to go on the new Cars ride.  What a thrill.  Only took 2 1 2 hours in line.
We were here for our son's second birthday and he had a blast, worth the coast to coast travel
We were lucky to be there for day one of the Christmas parade and  celebration!
We'll never go back to "baked"!
We're a Disney family. We like everything but the price..

Weak and vegetal, with just the barest note of Chardonnay juice, this is a pretty forgettable wine.

Well for a mcd's, it was decent
Well it is an upgradeable place where you can eat very tasty
Well it's a cloth and I use it to wipe my guitar.  This is a fairly good size cloth at that.
Well made & lined. great find for the fall!
Well made but strange fit. the medium was long and narrow, waaay too small.
Well organised, clean, get a fast pass to avoid the long lines.
Well shipped, loved by all
Well worth the money!  Best experience ever!  Purchase enough days to see it all!!!
Well, like everyone, I only like breakfast
Well, they are cautious because of the pandemic
Well-maintained location, however, order fulfillments are not swift/timely.
Wellness is Dangerous! Makes dogs SICK!
Went down hill for me.
Went in January of MLK weekend.  Very few long lines which made our experience more enjoyable.
Went on a week day and there were no crowds.  Had a blast
Went on almost everything here. I enjoyed Thunder Mountain and Its a small world.
Went the week of April 23rd.  Best time to go, no lines over 20 minutes :)
Went through  drive through normal customer service
Went to McDonald's yesterday fast friendly service order was done correctly!
Went to both parks, loved them both, to save money go with a park hopper 3day or more
Went to this location with my nieces and nephews and they enjoyed the indoor play yard.
Went when I was a kid and would love to go again. But, it was a trip I will never forget.
What A Great Buy!
What a adorable Bonsai!
What a bad staff do not hire to eat there
What a great day to spend with grandkids.  Always magical.
What a let down.
What a pleasant surprise! hugs in all the right places and a nice substantial material!
What a rip-off!
What a script, what a story, what a mess!
What am I missing?
What an hot offer
What are the 4 flavors??
What can I really say about Mickey D
What can I say about a guitar strap.  It fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price.
What can I say, it is Disneyland at Christmas!!!  Absolutely magical!
What can I say, it's MCDs, when the craving hits there's like no other.
What can I say, this thing rocks.
What can I say............... the happiest place on Earth !!   Pure magic!!
What can i say its McDonald's home of the best fries.
What can you say, but you don't have to be a child to really enjoy yourselves here
What can you say, there chiclets
What expected out of McDonald's would recommend
What happened? Blech!
What is the carbon footprint of this product?
What is there not to like about Disneyland?  Rides were great.  Weather was great.  Loved it.
What is this again??
What is wrong with the notifications ? Keeps saying not available.
What more can I say.
What the new number at Mc Donald
What the?
What will not make install
What wrong with the latest upgrade? Earphones-Bluetooth doesn't work with Line but others do.
What you think
What's Not To Love
What's not to like?  Disney is my favorite, try to go at least once a year.
What's so Funny?
What's there to say? It's the happiest place on earth!
What?  All These Folks Are Right?
What?  No ingredient list?
Whatever you guys did on update it made it worse. Very ...very slow receiving and sending texts.
Whats not to like; we even managed to find a restuarant that wasn't overpriced.
Whats the fuss?
When I ask for no salt on fries I rarely get it
When I go the line is so long in the drive-thru and they are slow but friendly
When I got the blackberry and went to Sprint to activate it, they said it was already active meaning it's a bad DEC therefore you cant use it.
When I play a video it turns white. Fix this please
When I tried to Enter an openchat, It said Unknown error is occurred, try again
When I'm open Facebook apps .Why this say Facebook is currently stop .
When facism and communism combine their powers, FacistBots are created...they be hide p3do groups.
When i chat my friends all of their text bubble is blank white and i don't know how to fix it
When i recieved the phone, IT WAS NOT DUAL SIM as the description said.
When i tried it on it looked like a stiff bathrobe. straight, too boxy.
When i update from then cant use bluetooth connet any more try so mant time
When i wore this dress i got tons of compliments! the quality is great along with the style.
When it works, its great.
When will Bluetooth with android issue be fixed
Where is my phone? In the box just charger , not phone
Where you place your food order at is not enough waiting space.
Where's the coffee?
Where's the liquor?
Where's the mouse?
Where's the peanuts??
While it's dry and acidic, it has a coarseness that's unforgiving.
While the creamy fruit is attractive, this is a light wine, with a touch of pear and apple flavors.
While the wine is clean and refreshing, its texture lacks definition. It has a soft, bright finish.
Whimsical and elegant. fits a bit snug in rib cage, but that works well for me. i'm a 32c.
White Stevia 12 Oz Pwdr
White fruits, almonds and soft, crisp acidity are the hallmarks of this lightweight, fresh wine.
Who doesn't love Disneyland!?  We go a couple of times a year and never get bored.
Who forgets to put meat on a sandwich? Brodheadsville MC Donalds that's who. I mean really?

With a watery taste, this soft, simple little Pinot Noir has modest raspberry and cherry flavors.
With apricot, orange, honey, butter cream and vanilla flavors, it's a simple wine at a fair price.
With its flavors of baked fruit and mushroom, this wine already tastes old and tired.
With its sticky sweet finish and raw acidity, this Zin-like wine leaves a lot to be desired.
With overpowering pineapple and almost a flinty quality to its aroma, this wine is simply sweet.
With zoo motif. Popular with the kids.
Without Xyrem, I am a complete mess.
